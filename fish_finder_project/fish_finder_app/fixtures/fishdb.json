Pelagic and migratory. Usually remains in deep clear blue tropical or warm waters, but makes seasonal migrations into colder zones (New England, South Brazil, and northern Gulf of Mexico).<br><br>The most distinguishing feature of this member of the tuna and mackerel family is its very long pectoral fins that reach to a point beyond the anal fin. The pectoral fins of other adult tunas may also be moderately long, but never extend all the way to the anal fin. Though the very long pectoral fins readily distinguish the adult albacore from other adult tunas, it should be noted that juvenile albacore might have shorter pectoral fins than similar sized yellowfin tuna, T. albacares, or bigeye tuna, T. obesus. The albacore can be distinguished from these species at any age by the lack of stripes or spots on its lower flanks and belly and by the presence of a thin, white trailing edge on the margin of the tail fin. The liver is striated on the ventral surface. The deepest part of the albacore's body is near the second dorsal fin, rather than near the middle of the first dorsal fin as in other tunas, and the vent is round rather than oval or teardrop shaped. The fins are dark yellowish, except for the white trailing edge of the tail. The anal finlets are dark.<br><br>Fishing methods include trolling with feathered jigs, spoons and lures; live and whole bait fishing with mullet, sardines, squid, herring, anchovies, sardines and other small fishes. The albacore is considered by anglers to be an excellent light tackle game fish. <br><br>In the United States the albacore is probably the most valuable tuna in terms of quality and profit. Its white meat is canned and sold commercially throughout the country, and, with the blackfin tuna, is the only kind that can carry the label 'white meat tuna.<br>",

In fact, some bass lakes believed to be 'fished out' contain plenty of bass but the fish have learned to recognize virtually all the lures in common use on the lake. In such cases, a lure that is new to them will often work where others have failed.

In waters cohabited by both smallmouth and largemouth, the largemouth bass will spawn a little earlier due to the fact that the shallower nesting sites they choose in protected areas with emergent vegetation warm to the optimum temperature sooner than the deeper, rockier sites chosen by the smallmouths.<br><br>There are many who say that the smallmouth bass is gamer than the largemouth. There is no doubt that it rivals the largemouth in popularity<br>",

Spotted bass can be found throughout the central and lower Mississippi basin to the Gulf of Mexico (from Texas to the Florida panhandle), including Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and other nearby states where it occurs naturally or has been introduced. The Wichita spotted bass appears to be limited to the West Cache Creek, Oklahoma. The Alabama spotted bass has been introduced into California.<br><br>Many anglers who catch a spotted bass believe they have caught a largemouth bass (M salmoides), undoubtedly because the coloration is similar, both having a greenish hue and a broad stripe of diamonds or blotches along the midline of the body. The spotted bass, like all black basses except the largemouth, has scales on the base portion of the second dorsal fin, its first and second dorsal fin are clearly connected, and its upper jaw bone does not extend back to or beyond the rear edge of the eyes. The spotted bass is also often confused with the smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu), but it lacks the vertical bars that are present on the sides of the body in the smallmouth. The spotted bass also has small black spots below the lateral line (the rear edges of certain scales are black) unlike either the largemouth or the smallmouth. Juveniles of the species resemble the young of smallmouth bass in having a broad band of orange at the base of the tail, followed by a broad black band and white edge. Because of the difficulty in recognizing the species, it is probable that record size specimens of spotted bass have gone unnoticed.<br><br>The smallmouth bass is known to hybridize in nature with the spotted bass, which could make identification of some specimens where both species are known to occur, even more difficult. Where depth permits, it appears that spotted bass usually stay deeper than smallmouths. In one lake in the TVA system in Tennessee, spotted bass have been taken at depths of up to 100 ft (30.4 m). Smallmouth bass, on the other hand, were not caught below 60 ft (18.2 m), and largemouths were always caught right near the surface<br>",

The sides and belly of the fish are bright silver. Parts of the fins and the snout may show a yellowish or dusky color. Bonefish are basically schooling fish. The smaller ones can be seen in large schools on the flats. The larger ones tend to form smaller schools or groups. They feed on crabs, shrimp, clams, sea worms, sea urchins, and small fish that inhabit the sandy flats and intertidal areas. They are often seen rooting in the sand, their tails breaking the surface of the shallow water; an action commonly known as 'trailing'. At other times they will plough the bottom stirring up silt and marl, known as 'mudding'. They are powerful and run very fast and hard when hooked. Fishing methods include plug, fly or spin casting from a skiff or while wading on tidal flats, using shrimp, crabs or similar baits. Most bonefish are caught in depths from 6 inches to 10 ft (15 cm to 3 m).<br><br>This species begins life looking more like an eel than a fish and undergoes a leptocephalus larval stage during which it grow to a length of about 2  1/2  in (6.3 cm); then during a period of metamorphosis the eel like larva shrinks to half its former size.

They have been widely introduced around the world for aquatic weed control and aquaculture purposes.  Because of the potential negative impact of the fast-reproducing grass carp on sport fish, sterile (triploid) grass carp were developed.  Fertilized eggs are shocked with hot or cold water or with pressure, causing them to retain an extra set of chromosomes.  They are called triploid carp because they have three sets of chromosomes instead of the normal set of two.  The aquatic weed control capabilities of the non-reproductive triploid grass carp appear to be essentially the same as the naturally reproducing carp.  Naturally reproducing populations are reported from the Danube River in Central Europe, the Mississippi River in North America, Russia and Southern Africa.<br><br>The mullet-shaped head with a terminal mouth and no barbel, coarse dark edged scales are distinctive features of the grass carp.  The dorsal fin, with 8 rays, is short and located at mid-body, above the pelvic fins.  Paired anal fins are short and attached low on the body.  The coloration is olivaceus to silvery white.  <br><br>While the grass carp might be reluctant to bite, once hooked they are strong fish that put up a tenacious fight and are known to jump.   <br><br>In some countries, grass carp are an integral part of fish culture and form an important source of fish protein for human consumption.

Like the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), it is an anadromous fish (migrates to the sea and back), though some populations are landlocked. <br><br>The complex of chars composed of Arctic char (S. alpinus), Dolly Varden (S. malma) and bull trout (S. confluentus) is a closely related group and difficult to distinguish from external characteristics. Due to past misidentification of species in various locales and lack of scientific knowledge, much of the available literature on these species is either misleading or incorrect, and there is still some disagreement among scientists on their distribution.<br><br>The Dolly Varden and bull trout can generally be distinguished by their size and habitat. The Dolly Varden is usually a coastal species whereas the larger bull trout is found inland in large, cold rivers and lakes draining high, mountainous areas. A much greater problem arises in trying to separate the Dolly Varden from the Arctic char. Much published information on the distribution of these species is incorrect and often presupposed that only one species or the other occurred in areas or rivers where it is now believed both species may occur. The two are outwardly almost identical in every respect and to complicate matters, significant variations occurs in both species. The spots on the Dolly Varden are usually smaller than the pupil of the eye, while on the Arctic char they are larger than the pupil. When returning from the sea both species are silvery and lack spots. Arctic char on the average have more gill rakers on the first left gill arch (25 30 as opposed to 21 22 in the Dolly Varden) and more pyloric caeca (40 45 as opposed to about 30 in the Dolly Varden), but fish with intermediate counts (i.e., 23 or 24 gill rakers and 35 pyloric caeca) are not at all uncommon in either species. <br><br>Fish that don't clearly 'fit the pattern' will almost certainly have to be examined in a laboratory to determine their identity. Since the problem of identification was only very recently even diagnosed, there are at present very few scientists who are qualified to make a positive identification on an unusual specimen. IGFA recommends that all potential record chars that cannot be positively identified by external characteristics be frozen in case further study is needed<br>",

There are reliable reports of goliath grouper or giant sea bass interfering with diving operations and occasionally even attempting to swallow divers.<br><br>Despite poor fighting ability, its great size and weight and its habit of swimming into a hole or between rocks when hooked, make it difficult to land. They can be taken on live or dead bait fished on the bottom from boats, bridges, or shore. Slow trolling also works on occasion. Baits include crabs, spiny lobster, fishes and cut bait.  <br><br>The goliath grouper is an excellent food fish at any size.  But, it is now totally protected from harvest in Florida waters<br>",

It is a coastal species forming small schools in the surf zone off beaches and rocky promontories. The leerfish is seasonally migratory, some populations moving south to the Cape in summer and north to Natal in winter, possibly following the sardine run which occurs at the same time.<br><br>Overall, this is a silvery fish with a leathery, scaleless appearance, though in fact it does possess minute embedded scales. The back is dusky to brown or blue gray, and the lower surface of the belly is white. The fin lobes may be black or dusky tipped.  The dart like body is further identified by the unusually curvy, sinuous lateral line, which arches high over the pectoral fins, then dips to or below the pectoral fins, then rises back to the midline as it nears the tail. There is a prominent lobe at the beginning of the long second dorsal and anal fins, a characteristic typical of many species of the jack and trevally family. Unlike many members of the family, however, the leerfish has short pectoral fins and no scutes.<br><br>The leerfish is a highly rated sport fish that can be caught by angling from the rocks or shore. It takes both live baits, such as mullets or sardines, and lures with zeal. It is not uncommon to see leerfish pursuing bluefish or mullet on the surface along the coasts.

In tropical areas distribution is scattered but continuous in open waters; denser in coastal areas and near islands. In temperate waters occurrence is rare. A few stray black marlin travel around the Cape of Good Hope into the Atlantic.

Such excursions are, however, regarded as exceptional. <br><br>It can be quickly and positively identified since it is the only marlin that have rigid pectoral fins that cannot be folded flat up against the body without breaking the joints. It is also set apart by the airfoil shape of the pectoral fins and by its very short ventral fins, which almost never exceed 12 in (30 cm) in length, regardless of the size of the fish.

When feeding or leaping, the black marlin may display light blue vertical stripes on the sides (see striped marlin coloration).

It differs from that of the striped marlin, or any other marlin, in that both margins are convex. The flat, movable pectoral fins can easily be folded flush against the sides of the body. The lateral line is visible and straight.<br><br>In overall appearance the white marlin is generally lighter in color and tends to show more green than do other marlins. Several light blue or lavender vertical bars may show on the flanks, especially when the fish is feeding or leaping (see striped marlin coloration). Some specimens have a scattering of black or purple spots on the first dorsal and anal fins.<br><br>A top rated light tackle game fish, the white marlin can be caught by trolling with small whole or strip baits as well as with small spoons, feathers or any of a variety of other artificial lures. Live bait fishing with squid, ballyhoo, mullet, bonefish, mackerel, anchovies, herring and other fish is also successful. It feeds on whatever species are locally abundant<br>",

While they are more common in the Indian and western Pacific, they are known in the eastern Pacific from San Pedro, California to the Galapagos Islands. Milkfish are a marine species that is also known to inhabit estuaries and, occasionally, enter freshwater streams.  Milkfish are coastal in nature and can be found in water less than a meter deep to depths of 30 meters.  Juvenile fish can be found singly in shallow water, while adults tend occur in schools around reefs.

The elongate body and deeply-forked tail are very reminiscent of a bonefish, while the mouth is toothless and terminal in nature like that of a mullet.

In addition, many anglers that have caught milkfish also believe that they are much stronger fighters than bonefish, making it highly esteemed by anglers.  However, they can be difficult to catch owing to their diet that consists primarily of algae, small benthic invertebrates and pelagic fish eggs and larvae.   Because of their affinity to small prey items, they are well suited for fly anglers that have the ability to 'match the hatch' with what they are feeding on at the time.<br>",

It has been introduced into Manitoba west of Lake Winnipeg. It rarely ventures far from cover, and prefers shallow, heavily vegetated waters less than 40 ft (12 m) deep, usually along rocky shorelines in slow moving streams and larger rivers.<br><br>At one time, it was believed that there were at least four species of muskellunge, but these 'varieties' are now considered to be one species, Esox masquinongy. The exception to this is the tiger musky, which is a hybrid, a cross between a muskellunge and a northern pike (E. lucius).<br><br>The musky and all other species belonging to the Esox genus have a distinctive body that is long and sleek with a single dorsal fin located very far back near the tail. The pelvic (ventral) fins are located relatively far back on the belly, about half way between the pectoral fins and the tail, instead of directly under the pectoral fins. The mouth is large with the maxillae reaching back at least to the middle of the eyes, and broad, like a duck's bill, but full of teeth.<br><br>It can be distinguished from the pike and the pickerels by several factors. It may be barred, spotted, or have no markings at all, but any markings that do occur will be darker than the background of the body. The northern pike, by comparison, has light colored, oblong spots against a darker body, and the chain pickerel (E. niger) has a unique chain like pattern on the sides. The redfin and grass pickerels (subspecies of E. americanus) look much more like the musky in their markings, but they only grow to about 15 in (38 cm) long. Another distinction occurs in the number of pores under the lower jaw. In the musky there are 6 9 along each side (rarely 5 or 10 on one side only). In the northern pike there are 5 along each side (rarely 3, 4, or 6 on one side only).

They may also be found in areas where they have been introduced, but such populations are naturally self limiting since the tiger musky is sterile and cannot reproduce.<br><br>It should not be confused with the true muskellunge which has long been called tiger musky in Minnesota. In most respects, notably in size and appearance, the hybrid is very much like the true muskellunge and anglers universally hold it in equal, and often higher, esteem than the true musky because of its rarity, its beautiful markings and its game nature.

The third distinctive feature is the number of pores under each side of the lower jaw; usually 5 in the northern pike (rarely 3, 4 or 6 on one side), 6 9 in the muskellunge (rarely 5 or 10 on one side), and 4 in the smaller pickerels (occasionally 3 or 5 on one side only).<br><br>It is considered a delicious food fish. The flesh is sweet, white and flaky, but like other members of its genus, it sometimes has a 'weedy' or 'muddy' taste during the summer months. This taste is probably due to the skin mucus and can be eliminated by removing the skin prior to cooking. It has considerable commercial value and is an excellent sport fish. Pike are usually taken by trolling with large spoons, plugs or natural baits, but casting and still fishing are also frequently successful<br>",

In North America it occurs from the San Lorenzo River, California, to northwest Alaska, and east to the Peel, MacKenzie and possibly Anderson Rivers. During spawning it is known to ascend some rivers for considerable distances 1,242 mi or (2,000 km). In the MacKenzie River, N.W.T., Canada, it travels all the way to the mouth of the Hay River and to the rapids below Forth Smith on the Salve River, entering both Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes and traveling through the Northwest Territories to the edge of Alberta. Like all Pacific salmons, with the exception of landlocked specimens, the chum salmon is anadromous.<br><br>At sea, it is silvery and has no distinct black spots, though it may have fine black speckling on the upper sides and back. Spawning males turn olive green with blood red vertical markings reaching up the sides, making this one of the most easily recognized Pacific salmon species. The color of spawning females is less vivid, but essentially the same. Breeding males of the species have large, bared teeth, which may be the origin of the name 'dog salmon,' though it is also said that this name evolved because this species was often fed to sled dogs. <br><br>The flesh is creamy white and the lowest of all the salmons in fat content. It is not as popular or as desirable as other Pacific salmons.<br><br>Together with the pink salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, it is sometimes called 'autumn salmon' or 'fall salmon' because it is the last salmon to make its spawning run. It begins entering the river mouths after mid June and reaches some spawning grounds as late as November or December. This late run severely affects its utilization as a sport fish, and it is not one of the most sought after by anglers<br>",

Infrequently, it has been reported at sea as far south as Baja California. It has been transplanted into the Great Lakes and into freshwater lakes in Alaska and along the U.S. Pacific coast as well as into Maine, Maryland, and Louisiana in the east, Alberta in Canada, Argentina, and Chile. <br><br>This is a silvery fish when at sea and has small black spots on the back, upper sides, base of the dorsal fin, and upper lobe of the tail. It can be distinguished from both the chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and the steelhead, or rainbow trout, O. mykiss, by the fact that it only has spots on the upper half of the tail while the latter two have spots over the entire tail. Also, it generally has pale or white gums and a black mouth (some Great Lakes specimens may have gray or black gums) while the chinook always has black gums and a black mouth.<br><br>Spawning females change very little. Males tend to turn somewhat darker on the back and a duller on the sides. During the spawning run they may also exhibit a red stripe along the sides, like rainbow trout. The males develop a kype, both the upper and lower jaw becoming extended and 'hooked' toward each other so that it becomes impossible to close its mouth. Like all Pacific salmon, it does not feed once it enters freshwater on the spawning run. Although most coho do not seem to migrate extensively, tagged individuals have been recovered up to 1,200 mi (1.931 km) from the tagging site. Some remain in freshwater lakes and streams, never venturing to sea. These specimens do not spawn and are replenished only by successive runs of migratory coho. An estimated 85 percent of native Pacific coho return to spawn in the same stream where they began their life. <br><br>It is a very important commercial species and is marketed fresh, fresh frozen, mild cured, smoked, and canned. The usual commercial catch weighs about 6 12 lb (2 5 kg) with 20 lb (9 kg) not uncommon. They can reach weights of at least 33 lb (15 kg)<br>",

The longfin mako has a blunter snout and a larger eye than the shortfin and much longer pectoral fins. There is a large, prominent, flattened keel on either side of the caudal peduncle. It can be easily distinguished from all other sharks by its teeth, which are like curved daggers with no cusps at the base or serrations along the razor shark edges. The front surface is flat and the teeth are curved inward. The back of the shortfin mako is a brilliant blue gray or cobalt blue and the sides are light blue, changing to snowy white on the belly including the lower jaw. The longfin mako is also blue above with light blue sides, and is white below except for the jaw. In life the mako's colors are the most strikingly beautiful of all the mackerel sharks. After death the colors fade to grayish brown.<br><br>The mako is a known enemy of the broadbill swordfish. In one case a 730 lb (331 kg) mako was found to have swallowed a 120 lb (54 kg) swordfish whole. It has been implicated in attacks on humans and is the undisputed leader in attacks on boats. A hooked mako will unleash all its fury, reportedly leaping as high as 30 ft (10 m) out of the water. It may roll, shake, dive, and charge the boat. It has also been known to bite the boat and occasionally to leap into it, causing severe injuries to the angler and wreaking havoc in the cockpit.<br><br>Fishing methods include trolling with whole tuna, mullet, squid, mackerel, or lures and also, chumming or live bait fishing with similar baits. Many are hooked incidentally while trolling for marlins. The flesh is excellent and said to be similar to swordfish.<br><br>The mackerel sharks (mako, white and porbeagle) are all ovoviviparous, the eggs hatch inside the mother and the young are born alive<br>",

The snout is perfectly conical and ends in a point, and there is a large, very prominent flattened keel on either side of the caudal peduncle. It is easily distinguished from other sharks by its teeth, which are smooth and have little cusps on each side of the base. It has a small secondary keel than the white.

The Atlantic bigeye thresher, A. superciliosus, occurs in the Atlantic. The longtail thresher, A. vulpinus, is found worldwide in warm to cool temperate zones. They are generally pelagic though they do come in close to shore. The longtail and pelagic threshers occur near the surface and the bigeye threshers inhabit deep waters, their large eyes undoubtedly aiding them in seeing at greater depths.<br><br>They are easily recognized because the upper lobe of the tail is usually as long as the rest of the body (appreciably longer in A. vulpinus). The caudal peduncle lacks keels, the teeth are small and pointed with broad bases, and the skin is smoother than that of most other sharks. The longtail thresher and the pelagic thresher have moderate sized eyes (1.2 1.5 percent of the total body length). The first dorsal fin is located almost squarely in the middle of the back, well forward of the origin of the pelvic fins. The Atlantic and Pacific bigeye threshers have much larger eyes (2.8 4.1 percent of the total body length) and the rear margin of the dorsal fin is located at least as far back as the origin of the pelvic fins. The belly and lower flanks of thresher sharks may be mottled.<br><br>Threshers are a solitary species but it is not uncommon for them to congregate when large schools of bait fish are available and occasionally hunt in pairs. Their diet is known to include mackerel, menhaden, garfish, needlefish and bluefish. Typically a thresher will slap or thrash the water with its tail to herd bait fish into a mass then use its tail to stun or injure individual fish before swallowing them. An angler may see his bait slapped out of the water then swallowed as it settles back in again, which is why threshers are often hooked in the tail. They are very active fighters when hooked and the longtail thresher has been known to leap clear of the water. Fishing methods include trolling in marlin fashion or deep trolling or drifting, depending on the species to be caught. Whole baits, strip baits, live yellowtail, snapper, or mullet may be used as well as feathers, or other baits or lures which are generally used for marlin or tuna.<br><br>They are ovoviviparous and give birth to 2 to 4 large babies, about 5 ft (1.5 m) long. There is no record of a thresher shark ever attacking a person, though there are cases of threshers attacking boats.  The flesh is of good quality but is more often used as bait or chum to catch other sharks than as food<br>",

Occasionally, it reaches as far north as Massachusetts and as far south as southeastern Brazil.<br><br>It is a handsome fish, varying from orangish to reddish yellow with small blue streaks on the head, back and flanks, and orangish fins. The colors may vary, as with most species of fish. A combination of factors distinguish it from other snappers. There is a black, oval shaped spot on the upper flank on each side, the anal fin and rear edge of the dorsal fin is angulate (pointed rather than rounded), the tail is lunate, and the dorsal fin has ten spines and fourteen rays.<br><br>Although at first glance the mutton snapper and the lane snapper may look exactly alike, both having similar coloration, a lunate tail and even the same oval spot on the upper flanks, a closer look will reveal that the lane snapper has yellow streaks or horizontal stripes on the body, whereas the mutton snapper has small, oblique, blue streaks on a yellowish background, though these tend to disappear with age. Also, the anal fin and rear edge of the dorsal fin of the lane snapper are not sharply pointed but appear to be squarish or even rounded. Of all the species of Lutjanidae having a dark spot on the flanks below the dorsal fin, the mutton snapper (L. analis) is the only one in which the tooth patch in the roof of the mouth has no median extension and resembles a crescent rather than an anchor shape. Large mutton snappers take on a reddish coloration and are often mistaken for red snappers.<br><br>They attain weights in excess of 25 30 lb (11 14 kg). They are strong fighters on light tackle and can be taken on natural baits or small lures fished or slowly trolled near the bottom. Normally associated with reefs, wrecks, holes, and channels, they are nevertheless occasionally found on the flats and can be caught there by fly fishing. They may also be lured to the surface and caught on a fly.<br><br>The flesh is firm and white and is excellent eating whether baked, broiled, or prepared by any other method<br>",

It is an in shore Pacific species, frequenting reefs and caves from shallow waters to 100 ft (30 m) or more.<br><br>Growing to at least 80 lb (36 kg), it is the largest of the nine species of snapper that occur in its range. The most prominent and recognizable feature is the 4 large canine teeth, two in the upper jaw and two in the lower jaw. They are slightly larger than the diameter of the pupil of the eye and are the largest teeth of any snapper in its range. There is a crescent shaped patch of teeth in the roof of the mouth and other small ones are on the jaws.<br><br>As a juvenile, it is purplish brown with a light spot in the center of each scale, but adults and older fish become deep reddish in color. There is sometimes a blue streak under the eye, and about 9 dusky bars may or may not be evident to varying degrees on the flanks. The tail is almost truncate, usually being very slightly forked to crescent shaped. The dorsal fin has 10 spines followed by 14 soft rays, the anal fin rounded with 3 spines and 8 rays. The pectoral fins do not reach to the anal fin, nor do they reach as far as the vent in adults.<br><br>The Pacific cubera snapper looks quite like the cubera snapper (Lutjanus cyanopterus) of the western Atlantic, the 'river' or'mangrove red' snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus) of the western Indo Pacific, and an African snapper (Lutjanus spp.). These three snappers and some others around the world, grow to sizes approaching or exceeding 100 lb (45 kg). All have deep reddish bodies, 4 large canine teeth, stubby gill rakers, and almost identical body and fin shapes, habitat, and behavior. These similarities and others are suggestive of a worldwide complex of large cubera type snappers that may be more closely related to each other than to most other members of the genus Lutjanus.<br><br> The Pacific Cubera is a strong fighter and sport fish that can be caught on live baits, jigs, spoons, feathers, plugs, or pork rind fished or trolled at up to 5 miles per hour. It is an active night predator of smaller fishes and crustaceans. It is excellent eating and is greatly prized as a sports catch<br>",

Popularly know as Niugini bass and Papuan black bass, this species is actually a member of the snapper family.   It is rated as one of the worlds toughest yet least-known freshwater fishes.  The fish inhabits large, snag infested jungle streams and tributaries and may occur in estuaries.  <br><br>The stocky Papuan black snapper resembles a cross between a mangrove (gray) snapper and a largemouth bass. The large scaled body is silvery to steely gray or black.  There are two distinct color phases with the entire body blackish or with a series of 6 or 7 broad grayish bars on the sides.  It has two large canine teeth in the upper jaw and smaller teeth on the lower jaw.  <br><br>Casting with saltwater-quality surface plugs or shallow and medium running plugs is the most common method of fishing for this species.  Papuan black bass are also caught trolling and a few have discovered that fly-fishing is possible.  The major challenge is stopping an individual before it dives for cover.

They are absent from the Bahamas and the Caribbean. Juveniles occur in shallow water over sandy or mud bottoms.  Adults are more plentiful offshore in 60 to 440 ft of water associated with rough, rocky bottoms and wrecks.<br><br>The pinkish to red color and sharply pointed anal fin (rather than rounded) distinguishes the red snapper from most other Gulf of Mexico snappers.  The snout is long and triangular and the eyes are a distinctive red.  Adults have no dark lateral spot, but juveniles have a dark spot on the upper sides below the anterior soft dorsal fin. <br><br>The Red Snapper is sometimes confused with the Southern Red Snapper, L. purpureus, found throughout Caribbean Sea from Cuba southward to northeast Brazil. There are differences, however, in scale and anal fin ray counts.  The Red Snapper usually has fewer scales in a row along the midside  (usually 47-49 not 50-51 and fewer scales between the beginning of the dorsal fin and the lateral line, (usually 8-9, not 10-11).   The Norther Red Snapper has more soft rays in the anal fins (usually 9 instead of 8). <br><br>This species feeds primarily on fish, crustaceans, worms and cephalopods.  They tend to be nibblers and pickers and soft touch is needed when angling.  Red snanpper seem to prefer a still or slowly moving bait.  Squid, whole fish and cut bait can be used to entice red snapper to bite.  By chummming them up to the surface, flies can also be used.  <br><br>The Red Snapper is one of the most valuable and heavily exploited snappers in American waters.  It is now closely protected; shrimp fishing, accused of destroying young snappers, is currently restricted.<br>",

The pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) and the shovelnose sturgeon (S. platorhynchus) occur only in the U.S.A., primarily in the Missouri and Mississippi River systems.<br><br>They are easy to identify as a group. Some species grow to a length of over 20 ft (6 m) and well over 2,000 lb (907 kg) and may live to be over 100 years old. The body is long and heavy and is covered with 5 rows of large, heavy scutes. One row runs along the middle of each side, one along the back and two along the belly. The scutes become smoother as the sturgeon grows older and in some species, they may gradually disappear by absorption. On each side of the head there is a huge bony plate that serves as the gill cover. The rest of the head is covered with smaller bony plates. The mouth is protrusible, like a sucker's, and is preceded by four barbels resembling a mustache. The eyes are small by comparisons to the overall size of the body. The single dorsal fin is located far back on the body near the tail and directly above the anal fin. The tail is heterocercal (the upper lobe is longer than the lower lobe).<br><br>The sturgeon roe is the only true caviar. The largest and most highly prized eggs come from the beluge (Huso huso) in Russia. This species has been recorded up to a weight of 3,359 lb (1,524 kg) and a female weighing 2,707 lb (1,228 kg) caught in 1924 yielded 542 lb (246 kg) of roe. A smaller, highly desirable, sturgeon from Russia is the osietr (A. sturio) which produces a golden brown caviar preferred by some European gourmets. The sterlet (A. ruthenus), which is almost extinct, produces the legendary 'gold caviar of the Czars'.<br><br>The most highly regarded North American species is the white sturgeon, both for its flesh and its roe. It may produce up to 200 lb (90.72 kg) of eggs, which are readily marketed as caviar. Two other North American species, the lake sturgeon and the Atlantic sturgeon, are also well regarded. The latter is often referred to as 'Albany beef' and the roe of both species is sold as caviar. The green sturgeon although edible is said to have dark flesh with an unpleasant odor and a strong, disagreeable taste.<br>",

Except when spawning, females prefer cool, deep waters near submarine canyons or coral banks. Males prefer to remain in somewhat warmer waters.<br><br>Characteristically, it has a smooth, very broad, flattened sword (broadbill) that is significantly longer and wider than the bill of any other billfish. It also has a nonretractable dorsal fin, rigid, nonretractable pectoral fins, and a single, but very large keel on either side of the caudal peduncle. Adults lack scales and swordfish of all sizes lack ventral fins. The back may be dark brown, bronze, dark metallic purple, grayish blue or black. The sides may be dark like the back or dusky. The belly and lower sides of the head are dirty white or light brown.<br><br>This pelagic, migratory species usually travels alone. It uses its sword for defense and to kill or stun food such as squid, dolphin, mackerel, bluefish and various other midwater and deep sea pelagic species. Occasional attacks on boats have been authenticated by the recovery of swords found broken off in wooden hulls. One swordfish attacked Alvin, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute submarine, at a depth of 330 fathoms and wedged its sword so tightly into a seam that it could not be withdrawn.<br><br>Fishing methods include presenting trolling baits or deep drifting at night with bait such as squid. They often bask on the surface with their dorsal and tail fins protruding from the water, making them susceptible to harpooners and longliners who make the majority of swordfish catches. They are finicky, easily frightened by an approaching boat, and rarely strike blindly. Usually the bait must be presented carefully and repeatedly before the swordfish will take it. The soft mouth makes hookup uncertain and the slashing bill can make short work of an angler's line or leader.  Squid is the most popular bait, though Spanish mackerel, eel, mullet, herring, tuna and live or dead bonito are also used. To land a broadbill is considered by many to be the highest achievement in angling.<br><br>Very large swordfish are always females. The males seldom exceed 200 lb (90 kg). The meat of the swordfish is excellent eating, making this fish the object of large commercial fisheries<br>",

The pattern varies with the water type, with darker colors in dark rivers and lighter, duller hues in turbid water. Tambaqui look like their sharp-tooth cousins, the piranhas, but they possess a unique dentition.  The teeth are multicusped molariform and incisive teeth.  Tambaqui posses no maxillary teeth in contrast to the pirapitinga (Colossoma bidens) and all Brycon species.  There are two rows of teeth in the upper jaw and pair of conical teeth behind the row of teeth in the lower jaw.  The strong jaws and teeth enable them to crush large and often quite hard fruits and seeds of rubber trees and palm trees upon which they feed.  A secondary feeding adaptation found in the mouth of the tambaqui is long and fine gillrakers that are used, especially in young fish in feeding on zooplankton.<br><br>At flood times, tambaqui are found in the flooded forests.  During the dry season, they stay in rivers and fishing becomes more productive. Anglers locate tambaqui by finding a tree with ripe fruit or seeds; there fish can be found waiting to devour the fruit as it falls into the water.  Fruits and seeds or imitations of them are used as bait and the most suitable tackle is medium to heavy, for tambaqui are fish of brutal force and endurance that can grow to 50 kg (110 lb). <br><br>Subsistence fishermen often wait beneath the trees where they harpoon the giant characins when they surface to take the floating seeds.  This fish is the largest characin in the region and is an important food fish as well as an angling target.

This coastal fish can be found both inshore and offshore. Because of its ability to gulp air directly into the air bladder by 'rolling' at the surface, the tarpon is able to enter brackish and fresh waters that are stagnant and virtually depleted of oxygen. Such areas are relatively free of predators, thus offering a convenient refuge for the young.<br><br>The body is compressed and covered with very large scales. The lower jaw juts out and up. The teeth are small and fine, and the throat is covered by a bony plate. The dorsal fin consists of 12 16 soft rays (no spines) the last of which is greatly elongated. The back is greenish or bluish varying in darkness from silvery to almost black. The sides and belly are brilliant silver. Inland, brackish water tarpons frequently have a golden or brownish color because of tannic acid.<br><br>They may shed up to 12 million eggs. The eggs hatch at sea and the eel like larvae drift in shore where they undergo a metamorphosis, shrinking to half the size previously attained and taking on the more recognizable features of the tarpon as they begin to grow again. Tarpon, bonefish, ladyfish and eels all undergo a similar leptocephalus stage, but the first three fish all have forked tails even at the larval state, whereas the eel does not. Tarpon grow rather slowly and usually don't reach maturity until they are six or seven years old and about 4 ft (1.2 m) long.<br><br>Fishing methods are still fishing with live mullet, pinfish, crabs, shrimp, etc., or casting or trolling with spoons, plugs, or other artificial lures. The best fishing is at night when the tarpon is feeding. They are hard to hook because of their hard, bony mouths. Once hooked they put up a stubborn and spectacular fight, often leaping up to 10 feet out of the water. It was one of the first saltwater species to be declared a game fish<br>",

The tail and other fins may be an even more striking blue than the body. The anal and dorsal fin lobes often are white tipped and the tail black edged. Young fish lack spots (including the opercular spot), and have a silvery yellow body much like that of any other jack species. Even these juveniles are distinctive with their bright yellow pectoral fins and deep blue second dorsal and anal fins.<br><br>Adults are deep bodied and have strong scutes. The dorsal fin is moderately low, with 8 spines plus 1 very small spine ahead of the fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are long with prominent anterior lobes. The tail is deeply forked and the pectoral fins are long and falcate. The sloping forehead of the is distinctive giving this fish a profile that is readily recognizable to those who are familiar with them. Males are slightly larger than females and sexual maturity occurs at a fork length of about 15 in (40 cm).<br><br>They frequent deeper lagoon and outer reef waters during the day. In evening they enter harbors, channels, and shallow reef areas to feed, then retreat to the deeper areas. They feed actively on smaller pelagic fishes and other fishes and crustaceans. In the late evening and early morning, they can be caught by surf casters using small fish baits, crustaceans, or lures. They are also taken from boats over the in shore reefs with similar baits and jigs, and with spoons and feathers trolled at 3 to 6 miles per hour.<br><br>The flesh is firm and very good table fare, prized over most of the other species of ulua<br>",

Common in the waters off Kenya and other parts of Africa as well as off Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Hawaii. This is the most common of the trevallys found in Hawaii's and Kenya's waters.<br><br>The giant trevally, which grows to over 130 lb (62 kg), is the largest of the eight Caranx species which occur in the Indo Pacific region. It has a small oval shaped patch of scales in the center of the larger scaleless area on the breast in front of the ventral fins, distinguishing it from the bigeye trevally (Caranx (Caranx) sexfasciatus) whose breast is fully scaled. In some specimens (about 5%) this oval patch of scales is extensive enough to make detection of the scaleless area difficult. The body and head are usually very deep with a blunt snout. The lateral line is strongly curved anteriorly. The straight portion is covered with scutes; 25 33 in the giant trevally and 28 37 in the bigeye. The first dorsal fin consists of 8 spines, the second of 17 21 soft rays, and anal fin of 3 spines and 15 17 soft rays. Gill rakers on the first arch total 18 23. There is no spot on the operculum such as is found on the bigeye trevally, nor is there a spot at the base of the pectoral fins such as appears on the crevalle jacks (Caranx hippos and Caranx caninus), the close Atlantic and eastern Pacific relatives of this species.<br><br>Adults are sedentary, prefer rocky areas near shore or outside reef drop offs, and feed most actively at night. Hawaiian anglers report that the darker the night the more actively they feed. It is a highly rated sport fish in the waters of Hawaii and Kenya both for its large size and for the hard fight it gives. Fishing methods include surf fishing, drifting, or still fishing using live or cut baits. Trolling with baits and lures can also bring results. Baits and lures include mullet, herring, sauri, garfish, anchovy, squid, cut strip baits, Konaheads, knuckleheads, bulletheads, feathers, plastic jigs, plastic fish and squids, drone spoons, and rope lures. The pinkish flesh is highly esteemed as food in some areas and is also frequently used for strip baits, cut baits or chum<br>",

It has been introduced in other areas, notably, Newfoundland, Canada, U.S.A., South America, New Zealand, and Africa. Today it is found throughout the U.S.A. in the Great Lakes area, south in the Appalachians to the northern edge of Georgia, south in some high gradient streams and rivers of the Mississippi River drainage system, throughout much of Nebraska, and in every state west of Texas and Nebraska to the Pacific coast. <br><br>It resembles its relative, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Despite the historical common names 'salmon' and 'trout', these two species belong to the same genus Salmo (see Salmon, Atlantic). Both have black spots on the back, upper sides, and on the gill cover, and sometimes have red spots. In fresh water especially near spawning time, both species are bronze to dark brown in general coloration, with black and (usually) red spots on the body and head. In salt water both species tend to become silvery with fewer black spots and no red spots.<br><br>Though both often occur in the same areas, they can usually be distinguished without laboratory analysis. In fresh water, brown trouts as a rule, are more heavily spotted than Atlantic salmon and usually a good number of these spots are surrounded by lighter halos. The spots on the Atlantic salmon have no halos and usually some of the spots will take the shape of X's or Y's, which is not usually the case in the brown trout. The brown trout also has dark spots on the dorsal and adipose fins and vague spots on the tail, though nothing like the prominent radiating spots on the tail of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The Atlantic salmon has no clear spots on any of these fins. Also, the brown trout's tail is squarish or very slightly concave or convex, while the Atlantic salmon's tail is slightly forked or indented. In juveniles the difference is much more obvious. The tail is slightly forked in the brown trout and deeply forked in the Atlantic salmon. Otherwise, these parr (young Salmonids) look very much alike with small exceptions. A positive distinction between these two species, usually observed in the laboratory, is that the brown trout has well developed vomerine teeth in a double zigzag row, while the Atlantic salmon has only a single row of poorly developed vomerine teeth.<br><br>The brown trout, like the Atlantic salmon, is one of the world's most widely distributed and highly esteemed freshwater (or anadromous) fish. It is a prime target of fly fishermen and one of the most difficult of trouts to catch by any angling method. It will sometimes be spooked by the bait or fly and at other times it will simply ignore it. <br><br>They sometimes hybridizes with the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) producing a strikingly marked fish called a tiger trout.

In 1978, Ted M. Cavender, a fishery scientist, published scientific proof that the bull trout is a separate species [Calif. Fish & Game 64 (3): 139 74]. According to Cavender, separation of the two species is'based primarily on characteristics of the head and cranial skeleton'. He further states that 'some of the characters that have been employed for many years in Salvelinus taxonomy, such as numbers of gill rakers and pyloric caeca, will not separate S. malma and S. confluentus.

Inland non anadromous forms occur from southern Alberta, Canada to as far south as New Mexico, as far east as Colorado and most of Montana and west as far as Alberta and eastern California. A small, disjunct population which may have been transplanted, occurs in northern Baja California, Mexico. The species has been transplanted to other locations, including the east coast of Quebec, Canada (1942), where it began to appear in fishermen's catches in 1966.<br><br>This is a highly variable fish, in coloration and size. The characteristic that gave the cutthroat its name is the yellow, orange, or red streak in the skin fold on each side under the lower jaw. The color of the body ranges from cadmium blue and silvery (sea run) to olive green or yellowish green. There may or may not be red on the sides of the head, front part of the body, and the belly. In some specimens there may be a narrow pink streak along the sides, but not as broad as in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The body is covered with black spots, which extend onto the dorsal fin, adipose fin, and the tail. Some are literally covered with spots, while in others the spots are sparse and larger, being more numerous on the posterior part of the body. On the tail, the spots radiate evenly outward as they do in such species as the rainbow trout, golden trout (O. aguabonita), and Arizona native trout (O. apache). While all of these species are very similar and closely related, only the cutthroat trout has hyoid teeth (teeth on the back of the tongue). These may be difficult to see or obsolete in some specimens. The tail of the cutthroat is slightly forked and all the fins are soft rayed.<br><br>The largest form (or subspecies) of O. clarki was once the Lahontan cutthroat, which was native to the Lahontan drainage system of Nevada and California, including Lake Tahoe, Pyramid Lake, and the Truckee River.

Despite its limited distribution, there are two recognized subspecies of golden trout: Oncorhynchus aguabonita aguabonita, which is confined to the south fork of the Kern River and Golden Trout Creek, and Oncorhynchus aguabonita gilberti, which is confined to the Main Kern and Little Kern Rivers. An area of warm water where the South Fork joins the Kern apparently serves as a natural barrier that keeps the two subspecies apart. Golden trout have been introduced to other areas, including the states of Washington, Idaho and Wyoming, which have self sustaining populations. It is believed that most of these populations have hybridized with the cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). According to Schreck & Behnke (1971. J. Fish. Res. Board Can. 28:987 98), most trouts in the Kern River basin are also hybrids of recent origin and the only pure populations of golden trout are those limited to the headwater areas.<br><br>Due to its coloration and markings it is considered one of the most beautiful of all freshwater game fishes. It is the only species of Salmonidae in which the parr marks on the sides typically remain prominent throughout life rather than disappearing at an early age. A red streak similar to that of a rainbow trout runs along the sides through the ten or so parr marks. The tail is golden yellow (as is most of the body) and is covered with large black spots that radiate outward toward the edge as in the rainbow, cutthroat, and some other closely related species. Usually the posterior part of the body is heavily spotted. The forward part of the body may have spots above the lateral line on the back and top of the head, but not always. The upper fins are golden yellow and heavily spotted. The lower fins are orangish or reddish with no spots. The dorsal fin and the ventral and anal fins have white tips (in some specimens) that are often separated from the rest of the fin by a broad black line. The sides of the head and 'throat' are a blend of rosy red and golden yellow. When this species is brought down from its high altitude habitat and propagated at low altitudes, it loses its brilliant colors and becomes steely blue.<br><br>It is considered to be a highly desirable and almost mystical species. Fly fishermen and other anglers have to match their lures to the types of food items available at the high altitudes where the golden trout occurs. Caddisflies and midges are most effective, through goldens have been caught with spoons, spinners, worms, salmon eggs, small crustaceans, and various small insects.

Spots may or may not be present on any of the lower fins and there are never any red spots such as occur on freshwater and spawning specimens of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Atlantic salmon (S. salar). The rainbow trout readily hybridizes with other 'black spotted' trout, especially with the cutthroat and golden trout. In fact, all these trout hybridize wherever they occur together producing fertile offspring with all manner of confusing color combinations and intermediate characteristics.<br><br>This is an extremely valuable species in any and all of its forms. It is the fly fisherman's delight as it takes a fly readily, leaps often, and fights hard. Though there is no direct commercial demand for the rainbow it is taken by Pacific salmon fishermen and it is pond reared in Europe and Japan to be sold as frozen whole fish. The flesh ranges from bright red in small lake and stream populations to pink or white in large lake, stream, and steelhead populations in which the diet is primarily piscivorous. It is excellent regardless of color and may be cooked in any manner desired<br>",

It is primarily an artificial cross, though it has been known to occur in nature. Because of genetic differences between the two genera (the brook trout is actually a char), mortality of the eggs and alevin is high. About 65% of hatchery specimens do not survive and the loss is higher in the wild where the majority of normal eggs and alevin perish due to predation. Hybrid specimens that survive are unable to reproduce. They have primarily been produced only on a small scale in private hatcheries for stocking in European club waters and in a few limited areas on an experimental basis. Theoretically, they might occur anywhere that brook trout and brown trout inhabit the same waters.<br><br>The wavy tiger like markings on the sides of this hybrid give it a unique beauty. It does not substantially resemble either of the parent species or any other salmonid. The overall color of the tiger trout is brownish on the back, lightening on the sides and belly to a golden yellow with a brown or orange wash. The back and sides both above and below the lateral line display large prominent sunshine yellow vermiculations, or worm like markings, that are much more vivid and extensive than those of the brook trout. The dorsal fin is also brownish with yellow vermiculations. Large brown spots may be present on the adipose fin. The tail is dusky with brown or black markings and yellow visible beneath the dusky color. The rear margin of the tail has a thin black edge. The lower fins are brownish to orange with char like white leading edges. The anterior part of the belly may be white.<br><br>Overall, it is stockier and more aggressive than either parent and thus more easily caught.

Pelagic and seasonally migratory, it tends to be a loner or travel in small groups of 2 to 6 fish. There are indications of seasonal concentrations off the Pacific coasts of Panama, Costa Rica and Baja California in the summer, off Grand Cayman (Atlantic) in the winter and spring, and off the western Bahamas and Bermuda in the spring and fall.<br><br>The upper jaw is movable and the teeth are large, strong and laterally compressed. The well defined lateral line dips noticeably near the middle of the first dorsal fin, further forward than on the similar looking tanguigue (Scomberomorus commerson), and is wavy back to the tail. The back is a brilliant, deep, blue sometimes described as metallic or electric blue. Bright blue vertical bands, or 'tiger stripes', flow down the sides onto the silver and sometimes join into pairs on the belly. These beautiful stripes are not, however, always prominent in large specimens and occasionally may be missing entirely.<br><br>It is found around wrecks and reefs where smaller fish that it feeds upon are abundant, but it may also be found far out at sea.<br><br>It is reputed to be one of the fastest fish in the sea, attaining speeds of 50 mph (80 km) and more. The first scorching run may peel off several hundred yards of line in seconds. Occasionally this fish jumps on the strike and often shakes its head violently when hooked in an effort to free itself. Fishing methods include trolling with whole, rigged baits as well as with strip baits or artificial lures. Live bait fishing and kite fishing are productive, but the wahoo is a relatively scarce species and is usually taken incidentally while fishing for other oceanic species. The wahoo has commercial importance in some countries. The flesh is finely grained and sweet and is considered excellent eating<br>",

In eastern drainages from Massachusetts southward it occurs all the way to the coast. It occurs from the Beaufort Sea south through Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and Montana to southern Arizona, the northern portions of Nevada and New Mexico, and then eastward to Georgia. Its western most limits are the states of Washington and Oregon where introduced populations occur.<br><br>The largest member of the perch family, it has been know to reach 25 lb (11 kg). Its closest relative and look a like is the sauger (Stizostedion canadense). Both have the large, glassy, opaque eyes that gave the walleye its name. In shallow water at night the eyes glow eerily under lights, readily identifying these fishes even before they can be seen. They sauger can be distinguished by the markings on their dorsal fins. The walleye's dorsal fin may be streaked, blotched, or plain, but lacks any clear spots and there is a prominent blotch at the posterior edge. On the sauger the fin is spotted and lacks any large blotch at the back edge. The lower lobe of the tail in the walleye is white tipped, a feature that is absent in the sauger. Internally, the walleye has 3 pyloric caeca each at least as long as the stomach, while the sauger has 3 9 (usually 5) pyloric caeca all considerably shorter than the stomach.<br><br>This is an extremely popular sport fish and an excellent food fish. The best fishing is at night when the walleye is feeding. The flesh is white to pink, firm and considered prime on the market<br>",

The centers of abundance are from North Carolina to Florida in the winter and from Delaware to New York in the summer. It is a schooling fish that occurs in shore over sandy bottoms in the summer and in deeper water, up to 55 fathoms, in the winter. It may be found in the surf, in bays, or in estuaries of rivers and creeks, but does not venture into fresh water.<br><br>The name 'weakfish' refers to the tender, easily torn membrane of the fish's mouth, rather than to its fighting ability. The lower jaw of the weakfish clearly projects beyond the upper jaw. Two large, recurvant canine teeth in the front of the upper jaw stand out noticeably. The first dorsal fin has 10 spines. The second has 1 spine and 26 29 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 spines and 11 12 rays. The scales are ctenoid and extend onto the soft dorsal and anal fins. In the similar looking spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) the scales do not extend onto the fins. Also, there are 11 13 gill rakers on the lower limb of the first gill arch in the weakfish, but only 8 9 in the spotted seatrout. Numerous small spots of black, olive or bronze are set close together on the upper flanks of the weakfish and seem to form wavy diagonal lines. The spots do not extend onto the tail or the second dorsal fin as they do in the spotted seatrout, nor are they as large or as widely spaced. There is sometimes a black margin on the tip of the tongue.<br><br>It is omnivorous and feeds on crabs, shrimp, other crustaceans, mollusks and small fishes like herring, menhaden, silversides, killifish and butterfish which it may catch in midwater or at the surface.<br><br>They may be taken at any level from the bottom to the surface by chumming from a drifting or anchored boat or by trolling, jigging, or surf fishing. Conventional, spinning and fly tackle may be used. They may also be taken from bridges, docks and piers. When hooked on light tackle the weakfish is prone to give a long initial run with sudden, unpredictable changes in direction. It is reputed to be the gamest species of the Cynoscion genus.<br><br>The meat is white and tender with a high moisture content and the flavor is excellent. The skin is usually left on during cooking to hold the meat together and the bones are easily removed once the meat is cooked. It does not keep well and should be eaten soon after capture<br>",

The wels mainly inhabits deep-water lakes and rivers, though it enters brackish water in the Baltic and Black Seas and spawns in the salt water of the Aral Sea.<br><br>Typical of the family, its body is scaleless. The anal fin is very long and three pairs of barbels, one on the upper and two on the lower characterize the jaws.  The speckled body is brown or gray-black in color.  The wels is one of the largest of all freshwater fishes. It is said to exceed 16.4 feet (500 cm) in length and up to 675 lbs (306.0 kg) in weight.  <br><br>Wels stay close to the bottom during the day, seeking cover in hollows or buried in the soft bottom it prefers.  This species is active at night, often in quite shallow water.  It is a voracious predator, feeding mainly on fish, frogs and crayfish.  Occasionally it takes voles and waterfowl.  Tales of it attacking and drowning dogs and even children, but these are based on hearsay, rather than observation.  <br><br>Angling for wels is highly valued sport both for its size and skill required.  The species can be caught by ledgering with live or dead fishes, by surface float fishing using a large float or even by trolling.  Spinners, plugs and imitations of mice and frogs are also frequently used. <br><br>The orangish flesh is practically boneless and very tasty, but large specimens tend to be too greasy.  The eggs are used as caviar by themselves, or to adulterate true sturgeon caviar<br>",

North of the equator the southern yellowtail is replaced by the California yellowtail, Seriola lalandi dorsalis (Gill, 1863) and the Asian yellowtail, Seriola lalandi aureovittata Schlegel, 1844<br><br>It is currently believed that the worldwide yellowtail complex is one species, Seriola lalandi. However, three subspecies are recognized, primarily because of their disjunct distribution and the fact that they do not interact. The subspecies are California yellowtail (Seriola lalandi dorsalis), Asian yellowtail (Seriola lalandi aureovittata), and southern yellowtail (Seriola lalandi lalandi). <br><br>The yellowtail is a coastal, schooling fish that sometimes enters estuaries. It has been reported to occur occasionally in very large schools in the Gulf of California. It feeds predominantly in the morning and late afternoon on small fishes, invertebrates, and pelagic crabs. Small to medium size fish generally undertake seasonal migrations. Larger individuals are more solitary and less migratory.<br><br>The yellowtail is easily recognized by its bright yellow tail and a characteristic brass colored stripe that runs along the median line of the flanks from the tip of the snout to the tail. It is closely related to the greater amberjack. It can be distinguished by the greater number of developed gill rakers, 21 28 on the first arch, while the amberjack has 11 16. <br><br>The yellowtail is a fast swimmer. The strike is vicious and is followed by a long, hard run and sometimes two or three shorter runs before the fish is boated. Fishing methods include trolling or casting with live baits or with lures. The yellowtail's habit of driving bait fish up against the shore makes casting from the beach possible at times. The advice of experts is to allow time for the bait to be swallowed, then strike hard. <br><br>Although opinions vary regarding the food value of this species it is generally highly regarded, with smaller specimens receiving the better ratings<br>",

It has been introduced into several other European countries, including England and is rapidly extending its range. This species has depleted stocks of native fish in some areas where it has been introduced for angling. <br><br>The zander is very similar in body form and coloration to its close relative, the walleye, of North America.  It is a slender fish with a pointed snout and a mouth with large, fang-like teeth.  In large fish the upper jaw extends well beyond the center of the eye.  The first and second dorsal fins are separate and both the dorsal and caudal fins have dark spots.  The dark elongated spots on the dorsal fins form broken stripes.  Color varies from greenish-gray to brown on the back and sides becoming lighter on the lower sides and white on the belly.<br><br>The Zander is a predatory species most abundant in large lakes and lowland rivers, preferring cloudy water and avoiding weed-beds.  It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, remaining inactive at other times, usually close to the bottom.  While young Zanders are found in small schools with larger individuals becoming solitary.  <br><br>The Zanders are not spectacular fighters, but due to their ability to offer a dogged resistance, they are valuable sporting fish. Methods of fishing similar to those used for northern pike but with lighter tackle.  Most anglers freeline or ledger live or dead baits.  Others find float fishing or using lures effective. In inland Europe, the Zander is an important food fish<br>",
